**Major changes: Fixed FlankerRep and TargetRep to include duplications (e.g., 130 followed by 130). Added model with TargetRep included as covariate.**


### 1. N2
“Current” trial will be included if:  
1) Current trial is not rejected due to artifacts.  
2) Current trial is not the first trial of the block (i.e. trial 1, 101, 201, 301 etc. are not included).  
3) Both current trial and previous trial are correct.  

The following electrodes are included: F3, Fz, F4, FC3, FCz, FC4, C3, Cz, C4.

The following subjects were excluded:
- 92 (wrong number of trials, possibly data collection error)
- 64 (<50% accuracy rate)
- 65 (only 187 usable trials (23.3%))

One or more electrodes were bad for subjects 19, 74, and 137 (data from those electrodes is discarded).

Besides that, ERP data is completely missing for subs 36, 37, 39, 40, 42, 43, 46, 51, 53, 54, 56, 57, 78.

**Total sample is 36 subjects.**

Trigger Codes:
Comp: Target Left, Flanker Left = 110.  
Comp: Target Right, Flanker Right = 130.  
Incomp: Target Left, Flanker Right = 150.  
Incomp: Target Right, Flanker Left = 170.  

CompleteRep (24.3%) = repetition of same trial (e.g., excludes 110 following 110)    
AnyRep (74.8%) = either target or flanker is repeated (only includes 110/130 pair, 150/170 pair)  
TargetRep (~50%) = target is repeated (excludes 150/110 pair, 170/130 pair)  
FlankerRep (~50%) = flanker is repeated (excludes 150/130 pair, 170/110 pair)  

```{r}
N2.correct = read.delim("./N2_AllSubs_TBT_Cond_Prev_Rep.txt") # made by Curt. Same number of trials as "AllSubs_TBTaverages_N2_Correct_withPrevious_EventFixed.txt", which was used in submission 1 analyses

# Fix TargetRep and FlankerRep columns to flag duplications
N2.correct$TargetRep[N2.correct$prevCondTrigger == N2.correct$currCondTrigger] = 1
N2.correct$FlankerRep[N2.correct$prevCondTrigger == N2.correct$currCondTrigger] = 1

# add effect codes for categorical variables
N2.correct$Previous = NA
N2.correct$Previous[N2.correct$prevCond == "compat"] = -1
N2.correct$Previous[N2.correct$prevCond == "incompat"] = 1

N2.correct$Current = NA
N2.correct$Current[N2.correct$Condition == "Comp"] = -1
N2.correct$Current[N2.correct$Condition == "InComp"] = 1

# rescale trial
N2.correct$Trial.begin = (N2.correct$Trial-2)/100
# shift trial to look at fixed effects at middle and end of task as well
N2.correct$Trial.middle = N2.correct$Trial.begin - 4
N2.correct$Trial.end = N2.correct$Trial.begin - 8

##### Simple slopes

Trial is scaled to range from 0 to 8 (instead of 1 to 800) so that the betas associated with trial are a little bigger (but significance testing is unaffected by linear scaling, so the test statistics and p values will be the same as if we used the unscaled Trial variable).
